# Streamlit-WebRTC

**Real-time video and audio processing in Streamlit apps** âœ¨

Transform your [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) applications with live video and audio streams. `streamlit-webrtc` bridges the gap between web browsers and Python, enabling real-time media processing with WebRTC technology.

## âœ¨ What You Can Build

- **Live video apps** - Object detection, image filtering, and video processing in real-time
- **Live audio apps** - Live audio filtering, effects processing, and sound analysis in real-time
- **Recording tools** - Capture video/audio streams with custom processing pipelines
- **Media streaming** - Stream and transform pre-recorded files or live camera feeds
- **Interactive demos** - Build engaging ML showcases with immediate visual feedback

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```python
--8<-- "./examples/simple_loopback.py"
```

## ðŸ”§ Processing video/audio streams

Real-time video and audio processing with custom frame callbacks:

=== "Video"

    ```python
    --8<-- "./examples/video.py"
    ```

=== "Audio"

    ```python
    --8<-- "./examples/audio.py"
    ```

=== "Video & Audio"

    ```python
    --8<-- "./examples/both.py"
    ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Perfect For

- **ML Engineers** building interactive demos
- **Researchers** prototyping computer vision/audio processing applications
- **Developers** creating real-time web experiences
- **Educators** teaching with live examples
